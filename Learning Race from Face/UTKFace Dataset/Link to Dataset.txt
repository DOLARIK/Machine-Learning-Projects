------------------------------------
Dataset that I used - 

1) Downloaded the Aligned&Cropped Dataset
2) You'll be redirected to A Google Drive link and you will be asked to download the folder.
3) You'll have to download the file named 'UTKFace.tar.gz'
------------------------------------
My code will do the rest of the extraction and importing and training work.

4) Run 'Race_from_Face.m'.

# I have made a Dynamic Convolutional Neural Network.
# You can make your own model and train on the network by answering a few questions asked by the code.

## For more Information See the Folder named 'Convolutional Neural Network' in the same Repository.
