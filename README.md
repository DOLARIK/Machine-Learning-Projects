All the Projects related to Machine Learning

Here I upload all the unfinished projects in their respective folders. Once the project touches the finish line I create a separate repository for the respective project.

# About the Projects

## Dynamic Multilayer Perceptron

I have designed a completely dynamic model of a Multilayer Perceptron in which we can give whatever shape we'd like to give an MLP. We can create a 1 Hidden Layer Model to a 1000 Hidden Layer Model to any Number of Hidden Layers we'd like the model to have in it just by tweaking some numbers. This frees us from adding a bunch of fresh lines of code every time we'd like to add just a single new layer in the model. It is easy and intuitive to use. It also occupies less space until the network architecture is decided.

## Dynamic Convolutional Newural Network

Just like the Dynamic MLP, I have built a model in which we can make however deep a CNN we wish to with the freedom to have separate parameters for separate Layers. We can recreate any model (not including the use of residual Layers), like LeNet-5, VGG-16, VGG-19 just by tweaking some numbers in the model input. This saves a lot of time while undertaking newer projects using CNNs. It lets us focus on other things rather than putting in efforts recreating or modifying famous architectures. This also requires far less space until CNN architecture details have been specified, resulting in a dynamic usage of memory.
**Updates in line** -
  - Capability to execute Transfer Learning
  - Dropout Layers
  - Residual Layers

## Handwritten Digit Classification using MLP and CNN

It is the ususal Handwritten Digit Classification employing the previous two models (Dynamic_MLP and Dynamic_CNN). 
**Updates in line** -  
  - Realtime Digit Classification
  
## Motion Detector

Name says it all. Program detects motion upto varying levels from None to Slight to Major, with capability of adjusting to the environment.
**Updates in line** - 
  - Capability of Adjusting to Significant Environmental change.
