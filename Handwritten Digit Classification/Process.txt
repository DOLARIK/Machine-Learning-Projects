We will work with a Vanilla Neural Network with N Hidden Layers 

How many Hidden Layers should be there? 
1
ReLU Slope = .1
Learning Rate (usualy start with .001) = .001
Regularization Parameter (b/w 0 and 1) = .9
How many Minimum No. of iterations would you like to have? 
5
When would you like to stop the Training? When the Development becomes < .2
 and Loss becomes < .1

How many layers do you want in 1st Hidden Layer? -> 
300
Iteration No. 1 || Loss = 0.500438 
Iteration No. 2 || Loss = 0.232346 
Iteration No. 3 || Loss = 0.174051 
Iteration No. 4 || Loss = 0.139839 
Iteration No. 5 || Loss = 0.114642 
Iteration No. 6 || Loss = 0.0956168
